# Interactive Web Occupancy Map

![alt text](screen_shots/interactive_web_ss.png )


This is a webpage that was used during the first return to university after the COVID pandemic. It provides a quick live update of the number of occupants per room through the use of color. This allowed for students and faculty to use this map as a resource to see at a glance the amount of foot-traffic within the spaces. 

This uses an interactve map built with vectors, HTML, and javascript. It then communicated, using pipedream as the backend with node.js, through webhooks and the SuperSaaS API, our reservation system at the time.
